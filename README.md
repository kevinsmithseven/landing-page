# My New Website Landing Page

## Description

This project was created as part of my learning process for HTML and CSS. This is a sample landing page for "My New Website", and was completed as part of my school curriculum.

In completing this project, I became more familiar with HTML structures and CSS styling techniques.

## Usage

Below is an image of the website landing page. Users will be able to click on each of the three links in the navigation area at the top and right of the page. Currently, only the Github link is active.
